                            <p>I had the opportunity to work in a small, early-stage company, shouldering significant responsibilities within a fast-paced environment. As one of only two designers, I spearheaded an end-to-end project to revamp a car hire insurance app, which has since made a considerable impact on both business revenue and customer satisfaction. The redesigned app has been successfully launched, and you can now download it here: <a href="https://www.icarhireinsurance.com/icarhireinsurance-app/" target="_blank">Car hire App!</a></p>

                            <p>I joined Halo Insurance in the summer of 2019, it was a small company,  consisting of just one other designer and myself. As a UX/UI Designer I worked closely with the founders and developers to create meaningful care hire insurance experiences.</p>

                            <p>The initial car hire insurance app faced harsh reviews for its complex interface.
                                Rather than easing stress, it hindered tasks like getting an insurance quote and docs access.
                                I tackled the challenge of enhancing user experience,
                                The revamped app reflects my dedication to modern, intuitive solutions.</p>

                        <div class="paragraphs">

                            <h4>Scope</h4>

                            <p>I was afforded the creative freedom to design based on best practices and insights gleaned from user feedback, leveraging both the existing help center and user reviews from the older app. As previously noted, this project was undertaken within the constraints of a small company, where resources, both in terms of design and development, were notably limited. Despite successful app development, optimal functionality remains a work in progress.</p>

                            <h4>Tools</h4>

                            <p>Figma | Miro | Pen & Paper | Google for competitors research and best practices</p>

                            <h4>What I did </h4>

                            <p> - Firstly, I conducted a comprehensive audit of the existing app, documenting its components and discussing requirements with the founders. Before using Figma, I explored mockups and sketches extensively, refining ideas through collaboration with the team, ensuring an informed and collaborative design process.</p>

                            <p> - I focused on creating a straightforward and intuitive design to direct users towards their intended actions. The policy quote process transitioned into a conversational experience, characterized by question-answer interactions, enhancing personalisation and user engagement.</p>

                            <p> - Transitioned from a lengthy and confusing side menu to an unobtrusive bottom menu, ensuring all important content is visible and within easy reach of the user's thumb.</p>


                            <p> - I improved the car hire insurance policies comparison by enhancing the layout and information architecture of the page. Prioritising key elements like policy type and presenting worldwide policies clearly allowed users to easily understand important details, such as prices, while offering the option to expand for more information. This approach streamlined the design and empowered users by providing control and comprehensive insights.</p>

                            <p> - Designed an intuitive 'Get-to-Buy' quote screen, providing users with comprehensive information about available extras and up-selling options. This approach aimed to enhance user understanding while simultaneously benefiting both the end user and the business.</p>

                            <p> - Introduced a new feature called 'Snaps' to assisted users in thoroughly documenting the condition of the vehicle.</p>

                            <p>I generated a rapid prototype to assess functionality and provide developers with a more comprehensive view of interactivity and features. Opting for a brief video presentation, I aimed to streamline the visual process. You can download the app here <a href="https://www.icarhireinsurance.com/icarhireinsurance-app/" target="_blank">Car hire App!</a>. It's crucial to note that, as previously mentioned, the development resources were limited, potentially affecting the app's functionality. Additionally, Halo Insurance, being a car hire insurance company, faced significant revenue challenges during the pandemic, where they operations ceased. Following a merger with Cover More.</p>

                        <div class="paragraphs" style="padding-bottom: 86px">
                            <p>What I found most gratifying about this project was the opportunity to engage in its end-to-end development, embracing a spectrum of tasks ranging from crafting illustrations, and considering hierarchy and information architecture, to collaborating with developers on feasibility. For instance, during the registration process, where an authentication code is sent, there was a thoughtful discussion on whether it made more sense for the app to default to the mobile number or allow users to choose. Although there were compromises, particularly favoring email delivery as per developer preferences and system constraints. This project presented a blend of learning, challenges, and hands-on involvement in a creatively liberating and relaxed environment, something designers typically find invigorating.</p>
                            <p>Overall, I gained valuable experience from participating in the end-to-end process and assuming numerous responsibilities. However, whether it was able to reach the market as it deserved is another matter.</p>
