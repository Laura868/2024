                        <h2 class="section-heading">Team & Role</h2>

                        <div class="paragraphs">
                            <p>Joining Kingfisher in the fall of 2021, I engaged in various teams and projects. In my initial year, I contributed to two teams, one primarily focused on end-to-end discovery projects related to the ecommerce site. This included investigations into the appointment booking system for home design projects and the development of new configurators for items such as curtains, blinds, and cut-to-size products. Concurrently, I worked on an internal Saas platform, which I'll delve into in this case study.</p>

                            <p>During the second year, my endeavors expanded to encompass UX design consultancy, extensive research collaborations aimed at selecting the right provider for a learning platform, and customer-facing elements like a PDP module for pagination.</p>

                            <p>Now, let's delve into the focal point of this case study â€“ the Saas product, an internal management platform. As the sole designer, I dedicated my efforts to create solutions for this platform, which monitored B&Q customers' kitchen, bathroom, and storage projects. Operating in a dynamic agile environment with 4-week sprints, I closely collaborated with the Product Owner, QA, B&Q colleagues, and developers.</p>

                            <p>The existing interface presented challenges in user navigation, project monitoring, and collaborative functionalities. The objective was to elevate the user experience by streamlining workflows, enhancing data visibility, and optimising the overall interface. This aimed to boost efficiency in project management and increase colleague satisfaction within the B&Q platform. This, in turn, would lead to improved customer satisfaction, as colleagues would be able to monitor customer-created projects on .com more effectively and follow up with them in a more comprehensive manner.</p>

                        <h4>Scope</h4>

                        <div class="paragraphs">
                            <p>In my role as a Product Designer, I played a crucial part in implementing impactful incremental changes to address colleagues' pain points. Regular meetings with the Product owner allowed discussions on colleagues' concerns, scope, and prioritisation typically dictated by business needs, as well as budget. The product manager facilitated this process by generating new Jira tickets with problem statements for my attention. My responsibility extended beyond the provided problem statement, involving an expansive search to streamline workflows and promote a user-centered design approach. The project's scope went beyond superficial aesthetic enhancements, influencing usability, efficiency, and overall user satisfaction, thereby enhancing the working environment and contributing to the success of the internal ecosystem.</p>

                            <h4>What I did</h4>
                            <p>I thoroughly investigated the problem statement, capturing colleagues' pain points and generating various proposals. These were discussed in weekly review meetings with the Product Owner and developers to ascertain scope and feasibility. This iterative process continued until reaching the approved solution, which I meticulously prepared in Figma. Recognising the need for a tailored design system for the internal platform, distinct from the existing e-commerce system, I crafted a comprehensive design system in Figma. This involved creating approximately 20 bespoke components, a few of which are showcased below, ensuring that future modifications or enhancements to the product could be seamlessly executed by anyone inheriting the project.</p>

                        <h4>Paralell project </h4>

                        <div class="paragraphs">
                            <p>To facilitate customers in scheduling appointments with B&Q staff for discussions regarding those kitchen, bathroom, or storage projects the colleagues were monitoing in the inernal platform, existed and online appointment booking system in .com. I conducted an investigation into the functionality of the existing appointment booking system, exploring opportunities for enhancements and improvements.</p>

                            <h4>What I did</h4>
                            
                        </div>

                        <h4>Pain Points </h4>

                        <img src="imgs/PainPoints.jpeg" />

                        <div class="paragraphs">
                            <p>Streamlining the customer journey is essential, and currently, there are too many steps in the process, some of which may not be necessary. While a progression bar is in place, it lacks clarity. Providing the number of steps required would reduce uncertainty and offer a clearer path of progression for customers.</p>

                             <p>Prioritisation in the booking appointment steps process needs improvement. For in-store appointments, customers are likely most interested in knowing their location options. The relevance of knowing the type of project comes after this. To better align with customer needs, consider changing the order of questions, placing the location query first..</p>

                             <p>There is a lack of explanation regarding what customers can expect from an online or in-store appointment. Adding this information will enhance the customer's understanding of the options available to them.</p>

                            <p>The absence of a preferred contact form selection results in users filling in unnecessary input fields. Introducing this choice would streamline the user experience.</p>

                            <p>The system currently does not allow customers to compare available dates and times. Implementing this feature would empower customers to make more informed choices.</p>

                            <p>Concerns arise regarding whether colleagues have sufficient information about customer requirements for a successful appointment. While customers are asked about the type of project, other crucial details such as room measurements might be overlooked. This aspect should be addressed to enhance the effectiveness of appointments.</p>

                             <p>The "Book an Appointment" feature is limited to registered customers. Consider autofilling some personal information for registered customers, such as name or email, with the option to modify if necessary. This would expedite the process and improve user convenience.</p>

                             <p>Finally, it is crucial to keep in mind the internal colleague interface. Understanding that a "desk" is part of the assigned resources for an appointment and is associated with a person in the "studio" is essential for effective coordination and resource allocation within the colleague JRNI interface.</p>
                                              
                        </div>

                        <h4>Suggestion</h4>

                        <img src="imgs/Bookinganappointmentsuggestion.jpeg" />

                        <div class="paragraphs">
                            <p>Presently, users face challenges when comparing available dates and times. A solution involves implementing a user-friendly date picker calendar. This feature would enable users to either manually input a date into the designated field or access the calendar through an icon. Once open, the calendar would intelligently gray out days without available slots, providing a visual cue to users.</p>

                             <p>To address the issue of slot visibility, the system would withhold displaying available slots until the user selects a specific date. This ensures accuracy in presenting relevant time slots corresponding to the chosen date.</p>

                             <p>Upon entering a date in the date picker, the proposed enhancement introduces a feature where time slots become visible for users to select their preferred time. Notably, this improvement allows users to compare time slots across six consecutive days from the chosen date. This empowers users to align the time with their availability without restarting the entire process.</p>

                            <p>A noteworthy refinement is that the "Apply" call-to-action (CTA) remains inactive until both the date and time slots are inputted. This ensures that users complete the entire selection process before finalizing their appointment, enhancing the overall efficiency and accuracy of the system.</p>                     
                        </div>

                        <img src="imgs/ConfirmationStep.jpeg" />

                         <div class="paragraphs">
                            <p>Grant users the flexibility to choose their preferred contact method, tailoring subsequent information requests accordingly.</p>

                             <p>Enhance the user experience by transforming the progress bar into a numbered stepper, complete with titles for each step. This modification aids in anticipating and discovering the expected sequence of actions.</p>

                             <p>Consider refining the layout by adjusting the split between the input field boxes section and the booking summary section to a more balanced 60/40 ratio. This adjustment prevents the booking summary from appearing cramped on the right, ensuring easy readability.</p>

                            <p>Explore the feasibility of enabling users to edit information directly from the summary. Additionally, for registered users, contemplate the option of pre-populating data, allowing clickable elements (hyperlinks) for the appointment type, date, and time. Clicking on these elements could redirect users back to the respective steps for easy modifications.</p>

                            <p>Verify user access to the booking appointment system. If it's limited to registered users, consider prompting non-registered users to create an account when adding their data.</p>

                            <p>Streamline the confirmation screen for a simplified and user-friendly experience.</p>                     
                        </div>

                         <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>

                         <div class="paragraphs">
                            <p>Upon consulting with the product owner and understanding that the type of project is a critical factor in determining the staff member leading the design meeting, it became evident that this information must be included in the early stages. Although it may not directly enhance the user experience, meeting this business requirement is imperative.</p>

                             <p>Given the necessity of prioritizing the type of project as the initial question, I explored ways to simplify the user journey. One approach involved merging the inquiries about locations and dates. This adjustment allows users to not only view available slots within a 6-day interval at a glance but also compare them with the available stores, particularly for those opting for in-store appointments.</p>

                             <p>To address the challenge of preventing simultaneous bookings, a timer mechanism was proposed. This timer engages users in the booking appointment process and grays out the slot for any other customers during that period. Additionally, incorporating reminders, such as notifications when there are 5 minutes left for the session to expire, serves to keep users engaged and prevents instances where customers initiate the booking process but abandon it, leaving slots unavailable for others due to prolonged inactivity.</p>
