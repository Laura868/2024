                            <p>In September 2020, I joined Cheil, an agency exclusively serving Samsung as its sole client. Throughout my tenure, I had the opportunity to work across various teams, including B2B, optimisation, and innovation. Despite there being a central design team, each of us was assigned to specific team dedicated to various sections of the Samsung site. This structure meant that within these teams, I functioned as the sole designer, directly engaging with Samsung (the client). Our daily stand-ups and reviews were conducted with the Cheil design team, comprising five designers and a head of design.</p>

                            <h4>Scope</h4>

                            <p>When I embarked on this project, Cheil had not yet secured consent from Samsung to venture into the B2B sector, as our focus primarily revolved around B2C offerings. However, through our extensive investigation and proposal efforts, we successfully paved the way for Samsung to broaden its collaboration with Cheil into the B2B realm.

My role encompassed thorough investigation and comprehension of both B2C and B2B site structures. This involved maintaining brand consistency, align with design systems from a B2C standpoint while delving into the specific customer demographics targeted by B2B offerings. Additionally, I meticulously analysed the information architecture of the pages. It's important to note that my work was intended as an initial proposal, with the aim of fostering a potential partnership and paving the way for future agile reconstructions of the B2B site</p>
