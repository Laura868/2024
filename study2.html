                            <p>During my tenure at Kingfisher from fall 2021, I engaged in diverse projects across multiple teams.</p>

                            <p>The primary focus of this case study is the development of a cut-to-size online configurator. As the Product designer, In collaboration with the research team I conducted research on the existing in-store offering, as well as the potential desire for an online cut to size service. Operating within a dynamic agile environment, I closely collaborated with cross-functional teams including the Product Owner, developers,the broader B&Q design team (including the team involved in the PDP), and other relevant teams integral to the facets this configurator could impact.</p>

                            <p>There was a desire to investigate if offering an online alternative to order pre-cut products could increase the number of customers using the service and ultimately bring more revenue.</p>

                                <p> After analysing user goals and competitor strategies, I initiated wireframe creation to align the UX strategy with business objectives. This involved align with other team and investigating the functionality of the Product Listing Page (PLP) and Product Detail Page (PDP), focusing on integrating the new cut-to-size service seamlessly. Efforts were also made to align with the existing design system and strategise the integration of the cut-to-size configurator within the current PDP (Product Detail Page).</p>

                                <p>I began with mobile-first wireframes, incorporating a custom cut-to-size configurator with a 3D preview. This idea was inspired by competitor practices and feedback from users during research who expressed interest in visualizing their cuts. The feature would enables users to visualise cuts and identify situations where additions are not possible due to limited timber surface.</p>

                                <p>After consulting with developers, we concluded that implementing a custom cut-to-size configurator with a 3D preview was too complex due to challenges in developing the required algorithm. Instead, based on research showing customer preferences for even cuts, we iterated towards a solution offering standardised sizes, which proved more feasible for both user experience and development.</p>

It is possible that this project may be revisited in the future. If that happens, there are expectations to conduct further user testing on the proposed versions in order to be sure the expectations of customers are meet for a cut-to-size online service.</p>
