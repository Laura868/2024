                        <div class="paragraphs">
                            <p>Upon joining Kingfisher in the fall of 2021, my engagement spanned various teams and projects. In my inaugural year, I contributed to two teams, with a primary focus on end-to-end discovery projects related to the e-commerce site. This involved delving into the appointment booking system for home design projects and developing new configurators for items like curtains, blinds, and cut-to-size products. Simultaneously, I was involved in an internal SaaS platform, a subject I will explore in another case study.</p>

                            <p>In the second year, my role expanded to include UX design consultancy and extensive research collaborations, particularly in selecting the right provider for a learning platform and enhancing customer-facing elements such as a PDP module for pagination.</p>

                            <p>Now, let's delve into the focal point of this case study – the cut-to-size online configurator. As the sole designer, I dedicated my efforts to investigate the current in-store offering. Collaborating with the research team, we devised a comprehensive user testing plan aimed at uncovering in-store pain points and understanding customer expectations for a potential online service. Operating within a dynamic agile environment with 4-week sprints, I closely collaborated with the Product Owner, research team, developers, the broader B&Q design team (including the team involved in the PDP), and other relevant teams integral to the facets this configurator would impact.</p>

                            <p>Currently, there is only one route for a customer to get cut to-size timber, the in-store one.</p>
                            <p>There was a desire to investigate if offering an online alternative to order pre-cut products could increase the number of customers using the service and ultimately bring more revenue.</p>

                                <div class="paragraphs">

                                <p>As evident from the attached screenshots, following my research and gaining a clearer understanding of user goals, I initiated the creation of wireframes. Preceding this, a comprehensive analysis of competitors was undertaken. It became imperative to harmonise the UX strategy with the overarching business goals and objectives, ensuring that the user experience becomes a pivotal contributor to the company's success. This led to an in-depth investigation into the functionality of the current Product Listing Page (PLP) and Product Detail Page (PDP), with a focus on how to seamlessly introduce and promote the new cut-to-size service at the PLP level. Additionally, efforts were directed toward ensuring alignment with the existing design system and strategising the integration of the cut-to-size configurator within the current PDP page.</p>

                                <p>I commenced the process with mobile-first wireframes, exploring a bespoke cut-to-size configurator featuring a 3D preview. This would allow users to visualise the cuts and quickly discern situations where additions were not feasible due to a lack of timber surface.</p>

                                <p>Following discussions with developers, we determined that a bespoke cut-to-size configurator with a 3D preview was too complex to develop. The algorithm required to detect the size of the timber and evenly distribute bespoke sizes provided by the customer posed challenges. Consequently, I iterated towards a solution featuring even cuts, based on research indicating that most customers preferred halves or multiples of the same size. This option appeared more feasible for both user utility and development practicality.</p>

                                    <li>The chosen option was a mixed tab menu, enabling customers to choose between preset cuts or a specific number of equal cuts</li>
                                    <li> For collect in store option, additional considerations that I had to address involved the fact that this service was tailored to function within a specific barcode system, namely EAN (European Article Number). Whether a customer is logged in or not, their access to the service remains unaffected. However, the location a customer designates as preferred during registration will impact its functionality, considering that not all stores may provide cut-to-size services (availability varied among stores).
